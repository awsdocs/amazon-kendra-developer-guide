# Using a Google Workspace Drive data source<a name="data-source-google-drive"></a>

You can use an Amazon Kendra data source to connect to Google Workspace Drive to index the documents stored there\. Amazon Kendra indexes the documents stored in shared drives as well as the documents stored in user My Drives\. By default, Amazon Kendra indexes all documents in your Google Drive\. You can exclude documents from the index based on the ID of a shared drive, the user that owns the document, the MIME type of the document, or their path\.

The Google Drive data source indexes Google Workspace documents as well as the documents listed in [Types of documents](index-document-types.md)\. The supported Google Workspace document types are: 
+ Google Docs
+ Google Slides

To enable Amazon Kendra to connect to a Google Drive, you must first use an administrator account to create a service account\. The service account must have read\-only permission for the user and shared drives that you want to index\. The account needs the following permissions:
+ https://www\.googleapis\.com/auth/drive\.readonly
+ https://www\.googleapis\.com/auth/drive\.metadata\.readonly
+ https://www\.googleapis\.com/auth/admin\.directory\.user\.readonly
+ https://www\.googleapis\.com/auth/admin\.directory\.group\.readonly

Once you have created the service account, download the key file to your computer\. You send this key to Amazon Kendra when you create the data source\.

You store the Google Drive credentials in an AWS Secrets Manager secret\. If you are using the Amazon Kendra console to create your data source, you can create the secret while creating the data source, or you can use an existing Secrets Manager secret\. If you are using the API to create your data source, you must provide the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of an existing secret\.

The secret must contain the following information:
+ Client \(service\) account
+ Admin account
+ Private key

The credentials are stored in a JSON string in the Secrets Manager secret as shown in the following example\.

```
{
    "clientAccount": "account email",
    "adminAccount": "account email",
    "privateKey": "private key"
}
```

The data source IAM role must have permissions to access the AWS Key Management Service key used to decrypt it\. For more information, see [IAM roles for Google Workspace Drive data sources](iam-roles.md#iam-roles-ds-gd)\.

You must create an index before you create the Google Drive data source\. For more information, see [Creating an index](create-index.md)\. You provide the ID of the index when you create the data source\.

You specify connection and other information in the console or in an instance of the [ GoogleDriveConfiguration ](API_GoogleDriveConfiguration.md) data type\. You must provide the following information:

+ The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of a AWS Secrets Manager secret that contains the credentials required for Amazon Kendra to connect\.

After you create the data source, you can:
+ Modify the Secrets Manager secret containing the credentials required to access Google Workspace\.
+ Modify the list of user accounts to exclude from indexing\.
+ Modify the list of shared drives to exclude from indexing\.
+ Modify the include and exclude regular expressions\.
+ Modify the MIME types to exclude from indexing\.

After you sync the data source, you can't remove the field mappings\. You can map additional fields\.

<<<<<<< HEAD
By default, Amazon Kendra indexes all supported documents stored on your Google Workspace Drive and any My Drives for your users\. You can exclude documents using the console or by setting the following fields of the [ GoogleDriveConfiguration ](API_GoogleDriveConfiguration.md) parameter when you create the data source\. Exclusions are combined with a logical AND, so if a file matches any of the exclusions it is not included in the index\.

+ `ExcludeMimeTypes` – One or more MIME types of the documents to exclude\. For example, if you specify the MIME type for Microsoft Word documents, those documents aren't indexed\.
+ `ExcludeSharedDrives` – One or more shared drive identifiers to exclude\. None of the files on the shared drive are indexed\.
+ `ExcludeUserAccounts` – One or more email addresses of user accounts to exclude from the index\. None of the files in the My Drive owned by the account are indexed\. Files shared with the user are indexed unless the owner of the file is also excluded\.
+ `ExclusionPatterns` – One or more regular expressions\. Files that match the pattern aren't indexed\.
+ `InclusionPatterns` – One or more regular expressions\. Files that match the pattern are indexed, all other files are excluded from the index\. Any file that matches another exclusion isn't indexed even if it matches the inclusion pattern\.

You can map Google Drive properties to Amazon Kendra index fields\. The following table shows the Google Drive properties that can be mapped and a suggested Amazon Kendra index field\.


| Google Drive property name | Suggested Amazon Kendra field name | 
| --- | --- | 
| createdTime | \_created\_at | 
| dataSize | gd\_data\_size | 
| displayUrl | gd\_source\_url | 
| fileExtension | \_file\_type | 
| id | \_document\_id | 
| mimeType | gd\_mime\_type | 
| modifiedTime | \_last\_updated\_at | 
| name | \_document\_title | 
| owner | gd\_owner | 
| version | gd\_version | 

The Google Drive API enables you to create custom file properties using key/value pairs\. You can map these custom properties to Amazon Kendra index fields\. You must prefix the name of the field with the string "property\." when you specify the field name\. For example, a custom property called "author" is specified as "property\.author"\.
