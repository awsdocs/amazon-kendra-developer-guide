# UserGroupResolutionConfiguration<a name="API_UserGroupResolutionConfiguration"></a>

Provides the configuration information to fetch access levels of groups and users from an AWS Single Sign\-On identity source\. This is useful for setting up user context filtering, where Amazon Kendra filters search results for different users based on their group's access to documents\. You can also map your users to their groups for user context filtering using the [PutPrincipalMapping API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/API_PutPrincipalMapping.html)\.

To set up an AWS SSO identity source in the console to use with Amazon Kendra, see [Getting started with an AWS SSO identity source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/getting-started-aws-sso.html)\. You must also grant the required permissions to use AWS SSO with Amazon Kendra\. For more information, see [IAM roles for AWS SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/iam-roles.html#iam-roles-aws-sso)\.

Amazon Kendra currently does not support using `UserGroupResolutionConfiguration` with an AWS organization member account for your AWS SSO identify source\. You must create your index in the management account for the organization in order to use `UserGroupResolutionConfiguration`\.
